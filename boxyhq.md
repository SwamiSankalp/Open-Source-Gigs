### **2. Build docker image for arm64**


**Is your proposal related to a problem?**
Apple M1 uses arm64 arch, we are currently only building amd64.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Use qemu and buildx to build both architectures and push the images.

**Additional context**
How is cosign affected by this? We'll need to ensure signing is intact for both arch.

### **3. Guard against email not being present in the attributes**

**Is your proposal related to a problem?**
If email is not present then throw an error, it is very likely a bad SAML configuration. Also some providers do not provide an email by default unless the mapping is added.

### **5. Guard against providers that expect users to provide a unique SP entityId**

**Is your proposal related to a problem?**
SAML Identity Providers are mean to provide their own unique entityId but JumpCloud expects this to come from the SP. This could lead to mistakes and collisions which need to be guarded against.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Check if entityId already exists and then throw an error if the details don't match. Also provide instructions for providers like JumpCloud, entityId could be generated on the back of the tenant and product to keep it unique.
