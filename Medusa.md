## Code Enhancement/Feature Requests
---

**1. Support filtering price lists by customer groups**

We want to add support for filtering by customer groups. We should extend the `FitlerablePriceListProps` here to include a `customer_group_id?` field of type `string[]` which would include the list of customer group ids to filter by.

**2. API: Complete a batch operation**

Completes a previously dry_run'ed job.

```
POST /admin/batch/:id/complete
```
**DoD**
  - [ ] should be idempotent - i.e. if trying to complete a job that is currently processing the completion step then nothing should happen and endpoint should respond 200
  - [ ] only your own jobs can be completed i.e. `req.user.id === batch.created_by` must be true
  - [ ] should call `BatchJobService.complete` which in turn calls the underlying handler.
  - [ ] Endpoint should not wait for the actual processing of the job to complete

**3. API: Cancel a batch operation**

 Cancels an operation that is in progress.

```
POST /admin/batch/:id/cancel
```
**DoD**
 - [ ] endpoint should be idempotent - e.g. calling cancel on an already canceled job is allowed and responds with 200
 - [ ] BatchJobs in a completed state should not be cancelable - should fail with 422
 - [ ] Should call BatchJobService.cancel; which in turn potentially cancels the jobs in the worker that are currently being processed.

**5. API: Get a batch job**

 Gets a BatchJob. This endpoint may be used for polling the status of a batch operation. To retrieve the BatchJob with id the authenticated user must be the user identified by `created_by`.

```
GET /admin/batch/:id

Response
- batch_job - { id, status, progress, ... }
```
**DoD**
 - [ ] should respond with the correct batch job
 - [ ] if the authenticated user is not the creator of the batch job they should not be able to retrieve the job
